##Installing the Jaeger Operator
There are different ways of installing the Jaeger Operator on Kubernetes
using Helm
using Deployment files


Reference - https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.43/operator/

Installing Cert-Manager

To install all cert-manager components, just run:

kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.9.0/cert-manager.yaml

By default, cert-manager will be installed into the cert-manager namespace.You can verify the installation with:

kubectl get pods -n cert-manager

You should see the cert-manager, cert-manager-cainjector, and cert-manager-webhook pods in a Running state. 



Installing Jaeger Operator using deployment files

kubectl create ns observability

To install the Customer Resource Definition:

kubectl create -f https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator/releases/download/v1.36.0/jaeger-operator.yaml -n observability

At this point, there should be a jaeger-operator deployment available.

kubectl get deployment jaeger-operator -n observability

NAME              READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
jaeger-operator   1/1     1            1           29s

Deploying the Jaeger All-One image
The operator (that we just installed) doesnâ€™t do anything itself, it just means that we can create jaeger resources/instances that we want the Jaeger Operator to manage.
The simplest possible way to create a Jaeger instance is by creating a YAML file like the following.
vim simplest.yml
apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
            kind: Jaeger
            metadata:
            name: simplest


The YAML file can then be used with kubectl:
kubectl apply -f simplest.yml
To check the instances that were created, list the Jaeger objects:
kubectl get jaegers
To get the pod name, query for the pods belonging to the simplest Jaeger instance:
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=simplest
Query the logs from the pod:
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=simplest
Verify Jaeger instance created:
kubectl get services -n default | grep jaeger
Jaeger UI
Open now the Jaeger UI, you can do that by using port-forwarding
kubectl port-forward svc/simplest-query 16686:16686
