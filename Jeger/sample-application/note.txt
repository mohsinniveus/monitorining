Use kubectl to forward the port:
kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pods -l=app="do-visit-counter-frontend" -o name) 8000:8000

Now, in a second terminal window, send three requests to your frontend application:

for i in 1 2 3; do curl localhost:8000; done

Each curl call will increment the visit number. You will see an output like this:

Output
Hello, World!

You're visitor number 1 in here!

Hello, World!

You're visitor number 2 in here!

Hello, World!

You're visitor number 3 in here!
